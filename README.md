DevConnector 
Social network for developers


This is a MERN stack application I built using the tools I learned in "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on Udemy. 
It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles, forum posts, comments, likes and more.

DevConnector uses a Express.js Backend with mongoDBAtlas cloud services as its database. For the front end I used Reac.js, bootstrap and some custom CSS classes. Redux is my state managment tool and I used jsonWebToken for user authentication
